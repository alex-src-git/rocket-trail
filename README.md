# Important!

I wrote this game I wrote for a game jam, back when I was **way** less experienced at programming.

The code is gnarly - please don't treat this as well writen code - but I've kept it here because I was proud of the game.

Maybe one day I will come back to this :smile:

# Rocket Trail
This is a little game I made in under 48 hours for a game jam titled “Game Maker’s Toolkit Game Jam 2018”. 

It is written in C# and uses the Unity Engine.
